In assignment 2, I filled the most parts of SimpInterpreter.java, which are required in this assignment, created classes, Matrix, Transformation, Clipper, ZBufferDrawable, DepthCueingDrawable, RendererTrio and WireframePolygonRenderer, and modified some classes like FilledPolygonRenderer and DDALineRenderer.

Mostly in SimpInterpreter, it wasn't so hard. Many of the blanks were very straightforward, though some functions concerning perspective projection were not done. The most difficult part is Clipper. My code was very ugly. There were lots of copy&paste redundant parts, which was also the case for FilledPolygonRenderer.

Other classes weren't so hard, but it took time. I also added some toString function to some classes for easier debugging.

Page5 was hard. I didn't know how to draw a circle and other things, so I could only do the pyramid and block letter.
