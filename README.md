# course Computer-Graphics
2017 Sept-Dec

Given a simple framework (only able to draw pixel), developped 2D and 3D renderers, clippers, lighting...
Code of 4 assignments can be run individually.

## Assignment 1
### -- implemented three line drawers and a polygon drawer

#### line renderers
* Panel 1: DDA
* Panel 2: Bresenham’s
* Panel 3: A drawing that alternates between lines with the DDA and Bresenham’s. The first line drawn is with the DDA, the second with Bresenham’s, the third with the DDA, etc.
* Panel 4: An anti-aliased line renderer

## Assignment 2
### -- interpreted a 3D graphics specification language (.simp), involving manipulating and transforming polygons and lines, and rendering using depth cueing

Parts of objects that are clipped if they are in the front of a certain flat in the 3D world (e.g. closer to uses than the screen)

## Assignment 3
### -- expanded renderer from assignment 2 with perspective, a polygon clipper, ambient lighting, and .obj file reading (For instance, turbosquid.com has free .obj files.)
