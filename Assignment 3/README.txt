In assignment 3, I finished ObjReader, and added and modified some functions in SimpInterpreter. Most important thing in SimpInterpreter is the camera command, which means the perspective projection. Also using command line to interpreter one .simp file was supported.

But there are still some bugs that I couldn't figure out. Especially in Page 3, I had no idea why it run like this. Acturlly I thought my implementation should be correct, though it was different from the sample.
